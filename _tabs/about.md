# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Pedro, a passionate cybersecurity student with 2 years experience as a safety technician based in Portugal. This website is a space where I share my journey, projects, and passions in the digital realm (as well as some more personal stuff)

The following is just some of the wide range of topics I hope to discuss and cover.

* SOC Automation Project (HomeLab)
* PNPT vs OSCP - journey, tips, etc...
* HTB boxes walkthrough
* Aerial photography (some photos I took a couple years ago)
* Gaming and cinema related

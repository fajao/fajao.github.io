# Codphish - ML-Based Prediction Service on Google Cloud

To enhance my "cloud skills," I signed up for Google Cloud's free trial, which offers $300 or three months to explore their services. To make the most of the ML model developed earlier, I used Google services to host this ML model on a public website, allowing everyone to try it: "**codph.mcfajao.com**".

> The website is currently down as I have exhausted the $300 credit provided by Google Cloud. If you didn't get a chance to try it out, check the video below.

## Architecture

## Creation Steps

### Development Process

#### Github Repo - Website Structure

First, we need to create our `app.py`, which will be responsible not only for extracting the URL features but also for integrating various Google Cloud components such as Databases, Buckets, and Users. Additionally, we used the Python library "**validators**" to ensure the user input is a valid URL:

```python
# Portion extracted from app.py 
if not validators.url(url):
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid URL'}), 400
```

Next, since we will use Docker to create an image for our service on Google Cloud, we need to create a `Dockerfile` in our project root and a `requirements.txt` with all the necessary libraries.

Our repository structure should look like this:

![diagram](/assets/img/codphish/042.png)

The static folder holds the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of our website. You can check all the code [here][1]{:target="_blank"}. 

#### Cloud SQL Instance

Before creating our Docker image, we need to deploy a Cloud SQL instance and database for our `app.py` to use. But before that, we need to enable the following APIs that we will be using in the future:

* **Compute Engine API**
* **Cloud Run Admin API**
* **Cloud Functions API**
* **Serverless Integrations API**
* **Cloud Logging API**
* **Cloud Build API**
* **Artifact Registry API**
* **Cloud Pub/Sub API**
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM) API**
* **Cloud SQL Admin API**

Next, sign in to Google cloud, click on the hamburger menu, and go to `Cloud SQL > Create Instance`. Create a **PostgreSQL** instance following these steps:

* Select the **Enterprise** option
* Name the instance and set a password
* Choose a region (we used `europe-west1`)
* Select the lowest Machine Configuration and Storage options
* Ensure the instance is reachable by Public IP

![!image_002](/assets/img/codphish/002.png)

![!image_003](/assets/img/codphish/003.png)

Create the instance and wait for it to be ready.

Next, create a database and a user for Codphish. Navigate to `Database > Create Database` and name it. For the user, go to `Users > Add User Account > Built-in Authentication`, name it, and set a strong password.

![!image_004](/assets/img/codphish/004.png)

![!image_005](/assets/img/codphish/005.png)

#### Cloud Storage Bucket 

The final prerequisite before building our image is to create a bucket to upload our ML model. Navigate to `Cloud Storage > Buckets > Create Bucket`, name the bucket and create it. After successfully creating it, just upload the ML model.

![!image_006](/assets/img/codphish/006.png)

![!image_007](/assets/img/codphish/007.png)

![!image_008](/assets/img/codphish/008.png)

#### Building our Docker Image

To build and deploy our image, as well as some future functions, we will use a service account with some specific roles: 

* Artifact Registry Create-on-Push Writer
* Cloud Run Developer
* Compute Load Balancer Admin
* Compute Viewer
* Editor
* Logs Bucket Writer
* Logs Writer
* Service Account User
* Storage Admin
* Storage Object Admin

Initially, the account only has the `Editor` role. To assign the required roles, go to `IAM & Admin > IAM > (Pencil Icon)` and add each role.

[!image_009]

Now, open a new Google Cloud Shell and run the following commands (ensure you are in the correct project):

```bash
# Cloning teh repo that contains the app files
git clone «github_repo»

# Build image
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/«Project_ID»/codphish
```

![!image_011](/assets/img/codphish/011.png)

#### Deploying our Cloud Run Service

With all components ready, go to `Cloud Run > Create Service` and choose the following options:

* Deploy an existing container image
* Insert your Image URL
* Name your service and select the region
* Allow all invocations

![!image_010](/assets/img/codphish/010.png)

![!image_012](/assets/img/codphish/012.png)

To enable our app to access the database and bucket, create these environment variables with the appropriate values:

* **BUCKET_NAME**: Name of bucket created earlier
* **DB_USER** & **DB_PASS**: SQL User information
* **DB_NAME**: Database name
* **INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME**: Check your SQL instance details for this info. 

![!image_013](/assets/img/codphish/013.png)

Finally, select the Cloud SQL connection and create the service.

![!image_014](/assets/img/codphish/014.png)

![!image_015](/assets/img/codphish/015.png)

After completion, we can access our website using the service URL.

![!image_016](/assets/img/codphish/016.png)

### Load Balancer and Cloud Armor 

Currently, we can access our website using the service URL, but is it safe? As it stands, our website is vulnerable to **DDoS attacks** (application and network layer) and web app attacks. To mitigate these, we can deploy a Load Balancer with a Cloud Armor security policy, which helps prevent a broad range of attacks and logs them so we can monitor any potential threats.

#### Cloud Armor Security Policy

Let's start with Cloud Armor. First, go to `Network Security > Cloud Armor Policies > Create Policy` and follow these configurations:

* Name your policy and give it a description (optional)
* Select `Backend security policy`
* Change the action to **Allow**
* In Adavanced Configurations, enable [Adaptive Protection][2]{:target="_blank"} (DDoS protection)
* Select `Create` 

![!image_017](/assets/img/codphish/017.png)

![!image_018](/assets/img/codphish/018.png)

Now that our security policy is created, we can add rules to deny access, rate-limit access, etc. After some time, I received requests from scanners trying different paths in search of loopholes. To counter this, I created rules to respond with a 404 error whenever they get triggered.

> Google Cloud has some preconfigured rules that we can use to prevent web app attacks. You can learn more about it [here][3]{:target="_blank"}.
{: .prompt-info }

```bash
# Rate limit rule creation using Cloud Shell
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 5500 --security-policy=codph-security --expression="true" --action=rate-based-ban --rate-limit-threshold-count=100 --rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 --ban-duration-sec=3600 --conform-action=allow --exceed-action=deny-404 --enforce-on-key=IP
```

![!image_019](/assets/img/codphish/019.png)

#### Google Cloud Load Balancing - Custom Domains

As we can see, our security policy is not yet attached to anything. We could create a load balancer and attach it, but instead, we will use Cloud Run's **Domain Mapping** capabilities to host our services behind a custom domain with Load Balancers and all their components (**HTTP Proxy**, **URL Map**, **SSL Certificate**, **NEG**, F**orwarding Rule**, and **Backend Service**).

To do this, go back to `Cloud Run > Manage Custom Domains`, select `Your Service Name > Custom domains - Google Cloud Load Balancing`, enter the desired domain ("**codph.mcfajao.com**" in our case) and click `Submit`.

![!image_020](/assets/img/codphish/020.png)

![!image_021](/assets/img/codphish/021.png)

![!image_022](/assets/img/codphish/022.png)

This way, all those components will be created by Google Cloud. 

During this process, an IP will be assigned to the Load Balancer, which we will use to create a DNS record. In our case, we just need to log into Cloudflare and add the A record with this IP.

![!image_023](/assets/img/codphish/023.png)

![!image_024](/assets/img/codphish/024.png)

> Ensure CloudFlare Proxy is **disabled**! We will use load balancer logs to block IPs, so we need to see the actual threat actor IP.
{: .prompt-warning }

After some time (DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours), your Load Balancer will be ready to receive requests.

![!image_036](/assets/img/codphish/036.png)

The final step is to make some changes to the custom load balancer. This includes attaching the **Cloud Armor Security Policy**, **enabling logging**, and adding custom request headers. 

Go to `Network Services`, select the Load Balancer, and click on `Edit`. Follow the steps shown in the picture below.

![!image_037](/assets/img/codphish/037.png)

![!image_038](/assets/img/codphish/038.png)

![!image_039](/assets/img/codphish/039.png)

![!image_040](/assets/img/codphish/040.png)

### Malicious/Scanners IP Block Automation

With our website running behind the Load Balancer, we will start receiving `WARNING` logs whenever a Cloud Armor rule gets triggered. Currently, malicious actors only receive a 404 page, but I want to block those IPs in the firewall. Instead of doing this manually, we can use **Google Pub/Sub** and **Google Functions** to automate the process.

#### Pub/Sub - Sink, Topic & Subscription Creation

Our first step is to ingest the load balancer logs and send them to Cloud Functions using the following components:

* **Logging Sinks**: Routes all Load Balancer logs triggered by a Cloud Armor policy to a Pub/Sub Topic.
* **Pub/Sub Topic**: Acts as a central point where all logs are collected.
* **Pub/Sub Subscription**: Ensures that logs published to the topic are delivered to Cloud Function.

To create our Sink, go to `Logging > Log Router > Create Sink` and make the following changes:

* Name the sink
* Select `Cloud Pub/Sub topic` as the service
* Create a topic (Just name it and leave everything as default)
* Create a filter to include only Load Balancer logs **triggered by Cloud Armor**.
* Select `Create Sink`

```bash
# Filter
resource.type="http_load_balancer"
logName="projects/cod-phish/logs/requests"
jsonPayload.enforcedSecurityPolicy.name="cod-phish-protection"
```

![!image_025](/assets/img/codphish/025.png)

![!image_026](/assets/img/codphish/026.png)

![!image_027](/assets/img/codphish/027.png)

Next, create a subscription. Go to `Cloud Pub/Sub > Subscriptions > Create Subscription`, name it, select the topic we created earlier, and create the subscription.

![!image_028](/assets/img/codphish/028.png)

![!image_029](/assets/img/codphish/029.png)

#### Cloud Functions

Now that all components are ready, we need to create a Function that will filter the IPs from the logs sent from Cloud Pub/Sub and create a Firewall rule to block them. Go to `Cloud Functions > Create Function` and follow these steps:

* Select `1st gen Environment`
* Name your function and select the region
* Select the **Topic** created earlier as the trigger and save it
* Add the environment variable **PROJECT_ID** and insert your project id in the value input
* Select `Next` 

![!image_030](/assets/img/codphish/030.png)

![!image_031](/assets/img/codphish/031.png)

![!image_032](/assets/img/codphish/032.png)

> Ensure the App Engine service account has the **Compute Security Admin** role for the function to work.
{: .prompt-warning }

Next, add our function code. Ensure to switch to Python 3.9 and that the **entry-point matches the function name**.

```python
import base64
import json
import os
import logging
import ipaddress
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

def block_offending_ips(event, context):
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    compute = build('compute', 'v1')
    project_id = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ID', 'codph-431423')
    firewall_rule_name = 'block-offending-ips'
    
    pubsub_message = base64.b64decode(event['data']).decode('utf-8')
    log_entry = json.loads(pubsub_message)
    
    offending_ip = None
    if 'jsonPayload' in log_entry and 'enforcedSecurityPolicy' in log_entry.get('jsonPayload', {}):
        enforced_policy = log_entry['jsonPayload']['enforcedSecurityPolicy']
        if 'name' in enforced_policy and enforced_policy['name'] == 'codph-security': # CHANGE TO YOUR CLOUD ARMOR SECURITY POLICY!
            if 'request' in log_entry.get('jsonPayload', {}) and 'headers' in log_entry['jsonPayload']['request']:
                offending_ip = log_entry['jsonPayload']['request']['headers'].get('x-forwarded-for')
            if not offending_ip and 'httpRequest' in log_entry:
                offending_ip = log_entry['httpRequest'].get('remoteIp')
    
    if not offending_ip or not ipaddress.ip_address(offending_ip):
        return 'No valid IP found to block', 400
    
    logging.info(f"Attempting to block IP: {offending_ip}")
    
    try:
        firewall_rule = compute.firewalls().get(project=project_id, firewall=firewall_rule_name).execute()
    except HttpError as e:
        if e.resp.status == 404:
            firewall_rule = None
        else:
            return f'Error getting firewall rule: {str(e)}', 500
    
    try:
        if firewall_rule:
            existing_ips = firewall_rule.get('sourceRanges', [])
            if offending_ip not in existing_ips:
                existing_ips.append(offending_ip)
                firewall_rule['sourceRanges'] = existing_ips
                compute.firewalls().update(project=project_id, firewall=firewall_rule_name, body=firewall_rule).execute()
        else:
            firewall_rule_body = {
                "name": firewall_rule_name,
                "network": "global/networks/default",
                "sourceRanges": [offending_ip],
                "denied": [{"IPProtocol": "tcp"}, {"IPProtocol": "udp"}],
                "direction": "INGRESS",
                "priority": 1000,
                "description": "Block offending IPs detected by Cloud Armor"
            }
            compute.firewalls().insert(project=project_id, body=firewall_rule_body).execute()
        
        return 'Firewall rule updated or created', 200
    except HttpError as e:
        return f'Error updating/creating firewall rule: {str(e)}', 500
```
{: file='main.py'}

```text
google-api-python-client==2.82.0
google-cloud-pubsub==2.12.0
```
{: file='requirements.txt'}

![!image_033](/assets/img/codphish/033.png)

![!image_034](/assets/img/codphish/034.png)

Deploy it, and that's it! Our function will start creating firewall rules to ban IPs based on the Load Balancer logs.

## Final Thoughts

Working on this project was a valuable learning experience, teaching me a lot about Google Cloud's capabilities and services. There were many times I had to study the documentation to troubleshoot and configure everything correctly. This project has motivated me to continue learning about cloud computing and explore other cloud providers. I'm excited to keep improving my skills and apply what I've learned to future projects. Thank you for following along with my journey.
